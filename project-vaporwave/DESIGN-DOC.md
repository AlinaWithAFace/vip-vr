# VIP:VR - Project Vaporwave

The goal in a broad sense is to *port the 1-to-4-player cooperative space shooter genre to virtual reality*. The specifics are going to change and it's not a your typical "academic" research goal, but it is a goal nonetheless. The main purpose is to learn to work together on a team on an interesting project that has many interlocking parts.

The game should have an emphasis on teamwork and cooperation in order to achieve goals which sounds really corporate until you remember it involves space, laser weapons and maybe kidnapping alien bunnies.

## Theme / Setting / Genre

The game takes place in space. See [Mike Diva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbM6WbUw7Bs).

## Core Gameplay Mechanics

Two to four players collaborate to steer a ship around a level in order to collect ... collectables.

The ship has its own health, which upon hitting 0 triggers a game over, the ship explodes, everyone dies, it's very violent and colorful.

This ship has various stations:

* Steering / ship movement control panel, which a single player can use to control the ship's movement and direction
* Gun stations, where a player can man a gun in order to defend the ship from nearby enemies
* Ship health, where a player can repair the ship by hitting.. something
