VIP:VR Assignment 0
===

Alright, so, there's a couple basic tools everyone needs to familiarize themselves with, the first of which is [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). Unity is one of the more popular game engines nowadays, it's got a comparatively easy learning curve and there are a lot of VR tools that are integrated with it. There are a ton of tutorials, but for now we're just going to start with the basics. Install Unity, then work through the [interactive tutorial series](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/interactive-tutorials).

Unity is/was bundled with Monodevelop, but self-identified coders will likely want a fuller IDE. The two that I'm aware of are [Microsoft's Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and [JetBrain's Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/). I personally prefer the later, but either should work for our purposes.

After you've done that, you need to be able to easily share your work and progress. We'll be doing that using two tools: [Open Broadcaster Software](https://obsproject.com/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/). OBS is a tool that people use to stream and record their screens, typically for streaming, but we'll be using it as a recording tool. Record your finished project in action, play around with it on screen for a couple of seconds, and save the video.

Once you've done that, the next step is to add it to the git repo. We'll be using this one: https://github.com/AlinaWithAFace/vip-vr-assignment-00. Name your video file Lastname-Firstname-assignment-00. Make a pull request using the tool of your choice, such at the command line, but a plugin integrated with your IDE or something separate altogether like [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) is fine too, as long as you know how to use it.

If you're completely new to git (cough Alex), please reply to this email with some times you're available for a brief walk through on either Wednesday or Friday this week. There are a lot of tutorials that will walk you through using git in a command line, which is fantastic if you have experience with it.

After that, reflect.

Think about the project, take a look at the [design document](https://github.com/AlinaWithAFace/vip-vr/blob/master/DESIGN-DOC.md) and the [task board](https://trello.com/b/MgesfKag). Games are made up of a lot of interlocking pieces, and if there's a specific tiny piece that you know you want to own, start looking into how that part might work. You don't have to commit to anything now, but ideally everyone has a part to call their own two weeks from now.

Extra Credit:

* If you self identify as a music man, throw together a 15 to 30 second music clip that you feel reflects the project's aesthetic.
* If you self identify as an artist, design an enemy or collectible (in Tiltbrush, on paper, whichever displays it best).
* If you self identify as a coder, make a script that uses unity's UI system in order to programmatically move a box.
